#I used FootBall api for fetch all statistics.

#You can find here: https://www.api-football.com/documentation

#I used fetch api and promises to get data from api

#I applied DOM manipulation to show data from table.

#In Standings page , I fetch all data in combobox from API.

#I used CHART.js for data visualization because it accepts array of data. So my API data also return array. So it was easy to integrate.

# I mostly used DOm manipulation for creating data because I have dynamic array also it is easy to create table elements without typing.

#In Fixture.html every images and data comes from API.

# In Transfer.html , every statictics comes from API and I used dom manipulation to show data within table.

#In Video.html , I used Youtube API to get vide and subscribe button. I used scrollTo method to adjust position of the video after DOM is loaded.

#Home Page, I used slice method within an array , because I showed 5 upcoming match only.
